          # Python 2.7 comes by default with the Ubuntu container CircleCI uses.
          # However it doesn't comes with python-dev which is required for installing pip. If not
          # installed there will be an error when installing some package called "wheel". The
          # next two commands fetches the pip install script and installs pip. After installing
          # pip we add pip to the path (so we can subsequently use the command "pip"). This is
          # required because awscli has other dependencies which requires the existence of pip on
          # the path. Finally we install awscli.
          #
          # It should be noted this is a pretty ugly hack to get awscli in a Node container. In
          # CircleCI v1 the images came by default with awscli, so this mess wasn't required.

          # If the branch is master we push the contents of the build/ folder to the
          # xinqi-li.com bucket on AWS S3. The --delete flag means we delete files in the S3
          # buckets if they don't exist in the build/ folder.
          #
          # Apparently each CircleCI step is run in a separate terminal session. That means that
          # the command aws that we put on the path in the awscli installation step is not on the
          # path. As a workaround I just call it directly from its full location: ~/.local/bin/aws
          #
          # After the S3 bucket has been updated with the new content we invalidate the CloudFront
          # distributions (the thing that caches the static assets all over the world).
          #
          # $CLOUDFRONTDISTRIBUTIONID is an environment variable defined at circleci.com.
